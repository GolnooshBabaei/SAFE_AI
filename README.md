# SAFE_AI

To fulfill trustworthiness, AI methods have to be safe. A safe application of AI must
satisfy four basic key-principles, summarised as: sustainability, accuracy, fairness and
explainability. “Sustainability” means that AI methodologies have to be robust, both in
terms of data and computation. “Fairness” implies that AI methods should not discriminate
by age, ethnicity, gender or other population groups. The “Explainability” key-principle
requires that AI models are interpretable in terms of their drivers.
